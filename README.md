## Introduction
Generic Stable Watcher is a simple script which will alert users via telegram on any exploitable price opporunities on a given pair of cryptocurrencies.

- The program is extendable where it can be used to monitor different chains (Ethereum, AVAX, Moonbeam etc.)
- Sends messages with no delay to a group via telegram
- The script can be used to either send numerous messages to give live updates on the exchange or only whenever there is a arbitrage opportunity
